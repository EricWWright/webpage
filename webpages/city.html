                <h1>So lets get into it...</h1>
                <p>To be quite honest i'm really into gothic fashion, and goth chicks.
                    <br> I have been into the gothic fashion since third grade but I never participated in the gothic fashion
                    until high school.
                    <br> Though I did still wear a lot of black.
                    <br> My usual wear is
                    <br> a black skull mask,
                    <br> black shirt,
                    <br> spiked cuff on my right hand,
                    <br> black leather jacket,
                    <br> blue or black jeens,
                    <br> A chain wallet and
                    <br> knee high combat boots with straps.</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div>
                <div class="picture">
                    <img src="../images/city.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <h1>Now onto goth chicks...</h1>
                <p>So this also started in third grade when I got my first crush...
                    <br> Her name was Dani and she was a huge tomboy.
                    <br> We would play together durring recess with a couple of other friends.
                    <br> Her normal dress was
                    <br> black boots,
                    <br> dark blue jens,
                    <br> dark or black colored shirt,
                    <br> and a black denim vest.
                    <br> I asked her out but she rejected me... &#x1F641
                    <br> She kind of got mad and called me wierdo or something like that.
                    <br> After all of that we still played at recess together until she moved in 5th grade.
                    <br> But ever since I met her I have been into goth chicks.</p>
