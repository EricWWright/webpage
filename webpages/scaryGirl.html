            <h2>So lets git into it...</h2>
            <p>To be quite honest i'm really into gothic fashion, and goth chicks.</p>
            <p>I have been into the gothic fashion since third grade but I never started protisopated in the gothic fashion
                until high school.</p>
            <p>Though I did still wear a lot of black</p>
            <p>My usual wear is: ...</p>

            <h2>Now onto goth chicks...</h2>
            <p>So this also started in third grade when I got my first crush...</p>
            <p>Her name was Dani and she was a huge tomboy.</p>
            <p>We would play together durring recess with a couple of other friends.</p>
            <p>Dani her normal dress was black boots, dark blue jens, dark or black colored shirt, and a black denim vest.</p>
            <p>I asked her out but she rejected me...:-(</p>
            <p>She kind of got mad and called me wierd of something like that.</p>
            <p>After all of that we still played at recess together until she moved in 5th grade.</p>
